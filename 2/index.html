            do you watch the reels i send you? *sus face* i doubt. i highly doubt. so here was a one. saying "when you both realise you are not going to live in same home ever again" isnt it true?  did it come
            across your mind? it did to me. months before the actual day too. that realisation was painful but sweet. liberating but with a little grief. you were such a lazy bird. but you still have to fly someday 
            right? guess our dad forgot that fact and a little something attacks him few nights and in the mornings he would tell me. yes his ignorance can be a little anger creator but again he's our father curdling like 
           a kiddo with something we all feel. i know even if we did live together someday. its not going to be same. like you wont be that lazy one on bed not washing dishes not folding clothes. not me getting angry at those silly little stuff and 
           say all those indian serial dialouges. dk they will be remembered by yall like i do.
           <br>i really wish i have had taken more pictures together. spent more time together. shared more laughs (who knows i would have fixed your bad humor *wink* )

                whyyyyyy areee we having all sad, could have been, should have done talksss. ayiiii no. so i really look forward  to do all those stuff we talked about. and to visit countries with you, talk about all the other things we never did or get to here before. 
                <br> P.S i love youuuuuuuu take careeeeeeeeeeee. Be goodd to self and yesss beware of the world. it can get suprising and cruel sometimes
                <br> anddddd your strong sister will always have your backkkkkk *kisses*
